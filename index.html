                <h1>PUP Quezon City Branch</h1>
                
                    <p>Originating from petitions advocating the establishment of an educational institution catering to the 
                youth in the National Government Center area, pushed by community groups and churches, and after talks 
                with local leaders and government bodies, the PUP Quezon City Campus marks a clear win towards the 
                struggle in people’s fight against ignorance. Officially laid out in a document on March 24, 1997, 
                the goal was to "start a branch or extension of PUP at the National Government Center, providing 
                quality education and affordable tuition to the urban poor in Quezon City, especially those from 
                NGCHP." Since kicking off in 1997, PUP Quezon City has consistently produced solid graduates in 
                education, IT, management, marketing, entrepreneurship, and office management technology, making 
                a positive impact on the competitive global stage.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p> The PUP Quezon City Campus, formerly known as PUP Commonwealth Campus, encompasses a 1.9-hectare wooded area. 
                    It was officially transferred to the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) by the Housing and Urban
                     Development Coordinating Council-National Government Center Housing Committee (HUDCC-NGCHC), facilitated through
                      a Deed of Assignment signed in March 1997. This transfer aimed to establish a PUP branch at the National 
                      Government Center, focusing on delivering quality education and subsidized tuition to the urban poor communities
                       of Quezon City.
                    <br><br>
                    Before this, the Sentro sa Ikauunlad ng Kasanayan at Hanapbuhay (SIKHAY) donated two halls, Rothlehner and Misereor
                     Building, to PUP in February 1997. These buildings, named in honor of the funding donors, now serve various 
                     purposes on the campus.
                    <br><br>
                    PUP Quezon City commenced its operations in 1997, initially offering a Master in Educational Management under the Open 
                    University System. Over time, the campus expanded its offerings to include undergraduate programs such as Bachelor 
                    of Science in Information Technology, Bachelor in Business Teacher and Livelihood Education, Bachelor of Science in 
                    Business Administration, Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship, and Bachelor of Public Administration.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, the campus provides a Diploma in Office Management Technology with a specialization in Medical Office 
                    Management. True to PUP's commitment as the "Pamantasan ng Bayan," the campus offers graduate programs, including 
                    Master in Educational Management, Master in Information Technology, and Master in Public Administration through 
                    the Open University system.
                    <br><br>
                    Presently, PUP Quezon City Campus comprises four buildings, including a recently constructed Academic Building, 
                    an Ecumenical Chapel, the Winnie Castelo Welfare Complex, and a covered court. Designed as a "Green Campus," 
                    it mirrors the layout of the PUP Main Campus, providing a conducive learning environment for students from the
                     northeastern part of Metro Manila, Rizal, and Bulacan.
                    <br><br>
                    The official recognition of PUP Quezon City Campus was solidified through the enactment of Republic Act 11347, known
                     as the "PUP Quezon City Campus Act," signed into law on June 25, 2019. This legislative milestone, sponsored by
                      Representative Winston "Winnie" T. Castelo and Senator Francis "Chiz" G. Escudero, underscores the university's
                       dedication to democratizing educational opportunities for economically challenged students. Originating from 
                       community petitions and negotiations with local organizations, the campus stands as a testament to the success
                        in the collective effort against ignorance and remains committed to providing quality education to urban poor
                         communities in Quezon City and neighboring areas.
